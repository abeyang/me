Major props to Mike Shuh and Nelson for making this awesome, iTunes-like carousel!

## Widget

![widget](@path/widget.jpg)

Assuming you've already installed the shortcode (check Installation), you'll still need to activate the widget. Go to Appearance &rarr; Widgets, and move "Gracepoint Banner Widget" to the "Header" box.

<div class="alert">
To deactivate the Banner Carousel, <strong>do not</strong> deactivate it from the Plugins panel. All you have to do is remove the widget from the Header box.
</div>

## Banner Images

Each "item" in the carousel assumes there are two separate images. If you look at the App Store (or iTunes), the thumbnail on the right is not simply the large image scaled down; it's a different image entirely. However, if you don't have a thumbed version, it's ok — the system is smart enough to scale down the large version.

<div class="alert alert-error">Abe: need to link to psd file</div>

The larger image is 835x345, whereas the smaller one is 115x265. We've created a nifty .psd file that you can use as a template (be sure to turn on guides).

## Uploading files

At a2f Riverside, we're upload all our banner images to Flickr (into a set titled "Banner"). From here, we link all our files into Wordpress.

## Wordpress Plugin

![plugin](@path/plugin.jpg)

The order of GP Banner Widget is LIFO — last in, first out. That way, whenever you add a new item, it will show up as the first item. Use this knowledge as your weapon.

<div class="alert-message">
<strong>Save often</strong>. I've experienced some wonkiness with this plugin. For example, before you add or delete an item, <strong>save first</strong>. Otherwise, hitting those side buttons might revert your changes to a previous state. You've been warned.
</div>
