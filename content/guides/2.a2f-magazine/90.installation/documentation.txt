## Base Theme

Go to the themes directory in the Wordpress installation (/wp-content/themes/)

Do a svn checkout from [Google code]: 

<code>svn checkout http://a2f-magazine-wordpress-theme.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ a2f-magazine</code>

## Shortcodes

Once it's checked out, go to the plugins directory (/wp-content/plugins), and symbolic link these items:

<code>ln -s ../themes/a2f-magazine/plugins/gp-banner</code>

<code>ln -s ../themes/a2f-magazine/plugins/gpevent</code>

<code>ln -s ../themes/a2f-magazine/plugins/gpphoto</code>

<code>ln -s ../themes/a2f-magazine/plugins/gpvideo</code>

<code>ln -s ../themes/a2f-magazine/plugins/shortcodes.php</code>

After doing this, go into Wordpress and Activate GP Shortcoder and Gracepoint Banner Widget.

To enable the Banner, you have to go to the widgets section and add Gracepoint Banner Widget to the **Header** section.

## gCal

In a2f-magazine/ create a new directory "php"

Go to php/ and add the following files ([download the files]):

* textile.php
* xml.php

Next, do a checkout of [gcal php] in that same directory:

<code>svn checkout http://gcal-php-framework.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ gcal</code>

Go into php/gcal/gcal.class.php, and edit lines 109 + 110 (<code>$userid</code> and <code>$magiccookie</code>). **This is specific to your gcal calendar** â€” you can find yours by going to gcal &rarr; calendar settings &rarr; private address &rarr; xml:

![calendar](@path/gcal-01.jpg)

You can tell this works by adding a public event to your Google Calendar, [following these directions].

## Disqus

### Create account

Go to [Disqus] and create an account.

Add a new site to your account.

![disqus account](@path/disqus-01.png)

Keep clicking next until you see the Wordpress option. Download the Wordpress plugin, activate it, and follow the instructions.

### Export existing comments

To export existing comments into Disqus (recommended), you should:

<blockquote>
Login to Disqus account
<br />Click "Export comments to Disqus" (Disqus will export current comments from Wordpress and import them into Disqus)
</blockquote>

### Finalize plugin

The following are generated for you in the plugin settings:

<blockquote>
Disqus short name - a2friverside
<br />Disqus API Key - 
<br />Disqus User API Key -
</blockquote>

Get the 'forum id':

<code>curl -0 -L "http://disqus.com/api/get_forum_list?user_api_key=[YOUR_USER_API_KEY]</code>

Look for the "id" field corresponding to the correct site / shortname

Disqus forum_id: a number, probably around 6 or 7 digits

Put these values in disqus_val.php (Disqus Forum API Key is the Disqus API Key)

At the end, it should look something like this:

![disqus in wordpress](@path/disqus-02.png)

## Categories

You should create categories like this:

![categories in wordpress](@path/categories-01.png)

The ones that are **not** important are Designs, General, Minipost.

If you're coming from the previous a2f theme, you'll want to rename:

* Memories &rarr; Recap
* Shorts &rarr; Minipost

If you're coming from another theme altogether, it's up to you if you want to follow the above naming conventions. However, the Magazine Theme is strongly associated to this, so you'll have to manually edit the theme to correspond to your categories.
