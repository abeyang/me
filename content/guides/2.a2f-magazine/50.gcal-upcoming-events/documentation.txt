## Adding Events

Adding events to the sidebar is easy via Google Calendar — as long as it's [set up] properly.

By default, events **will not** show up on the website. This is done so that you can share your events with team members ("Family Night") without worrying that it will be broadcast out to the world wide web.

To get events up on the website, add an exclamation (or a "bang") to the **beginning** of the event title, like so:

<code>! Life Group Kickoff</code>

For extra special/important events, add two bangs:

<code>!! a2f Welcome Night</code>

In the end, you should see something like this:

## Adding Locations

Adding locations is just as easy — just fill in the **location field**:

![adding location](@path/gcal2.jpg)

## Adding Links

Finally, you're able to link the event to another url (like a post with more details about the event). You can add the url in the description field, surrounded with square brackets, like so:

<code>[http://www.acts2fellowship.org/riverside/2011/09/10/fall-welcome-night/]</code>

The result will appear like this:
