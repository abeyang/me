## Insert Event

![add event](@path/add-event.jpg)

Inserting the above information will generate the following shortcode into your editor:

<code>[event date="Friday, Sep 9th" time="6:30pm" location="Hackamore" info="Dinner provided"]The Friday Night (TFN)[/event]</code>

The code above doesn't mean much, except that you can modify them directly to your heart's content. In the end, it will generate a neatly formated html code in your post:

## Adding Google Map Links

There's an easy way to add google map links to your event. Simply add an '@' followed by the address in the location field. For example, having this in the shortcode:

<code>location="Stratton Community Center @ 2008 Martin Luther King Blvd, Riverside 92507"</code>

Will generate this:
