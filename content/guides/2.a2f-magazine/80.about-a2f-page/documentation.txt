## Page

Create a new page. Title can be anything of your choosing, but slug should be titled **about**. The content area can be left blank, because everything is driven from custom fields:

![custom fields](@path/custom-fields.jpg)

Everything else (like the titles and the video) is hard-coded in  **aboutus.php**.

## Contact Us

The Contact Us widget is also baked into **aboutus.php**. Go in there and change the <code>$to</code> and <code>$subject</code> variables.

You can add (or remove) fields in the file as well. To make a field required, have a class "required" like so:

<code>&lt;input type="text" name="your-name" value="" id="your-name" class="required"&gt;</code>

**Please test** to see if the widget works. At best, it should:

1. detect when certain fields aren't filled, and it should
2. send an email to the address listed in <code>$to</code> when all the required fields are filled.
