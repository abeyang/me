If you're porting from the <a href="http://abeyang.berkmedia.org/me/projects/a2f-version2/">previous a2f theme</a>, then it should automatically play nicely with this new theme
</div>

## In a nutshell

* [Properly categorize] = good for long run
* BIG [photos] = FUN
* Don't link to Flickr; bring [Flickr set to your post].
* [Add thumbnails]
* [Featured] recaps are bigger on homepage. You can adjust thumbnail positioning for these, too

## Categorizing

![categorizing](@path/categorizing.jpg)

It's important to categorize your posts, because not only are all the subpages (Photos, Videos, Archives) driven by them, but the homepage as well. Moreover, categories are displayed on the homepage, so they also act as a signifier for users (people tend to click on posts with "photos").

So, right off the bat, if you're doing a recap with photos, you should check off **Recap** and **Photos**.

## Inserting Photos

Photos from events should all be stored in Flickr. From there, we can grab them and insert them into Wordpress.

Slick magazines often have **BIG PHOTOS**, and for recaps, BIG PHOTOS make them more fun. (Now, if you don't have good photographers, then you might want to rethink about it.)

So, grab the url of the image from Flickr (should be a .jpg), NOT the flickr set url. So, this is good:

<div class="alert alert-success">
http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6017/5955851941_0d9b569f43.jpg
</div>

And this is not:

<div class="alert alert-error">
http://www.flickr.com/photos/gracepointriverside/sets/72157627236226576/
</div>

Once you have the image url, plop it into wordpress:

![big photo in wordpress](@path/big-photo1.jpg)

And there you have it!

## Custom Fields

The following steps (gallery + thumbnail) requires you to enable your **Custom Fields**. To do this, go to the top of the post page and:

![enabling custom fields](@path/custom-functions.jpg)

After this, scroll down and you'll see your Custom Fields.

<a name="gallery"></a>
## Gallery

<div class="alert">
You can add multiple gallery buttons — just add multiple "gallery" custom fields.
</div>

So many blogs these days have links pointing to their Flickr set. Why do this — it's so hard to get people to come to your website, and now you're pointing them away from it. What if there's an easy way to include a Flickr set **into** your post — and make it look + feel better than Flickr? Well, you're in luck.

Grab the Flickr set ID, add a new custom field, and see the magic button appear!

And, if you like to add a name to the set, you can do something like this:

<code>72157627236226576: Apologetics Training Camp</code>

## Thumbnail

You're almost done! If you save now and visit your homepage, you'll see that there's a big gaping hole. Use a thumbnail (image url from Flickr) to fix it.

<a name="featured"></a>
## Featured

Recaps that have the category **Featured** will get more prominent space on the homepage. However, sometimes the thumbnail is off by a few pixels, so you can adjust that with another custom field.
