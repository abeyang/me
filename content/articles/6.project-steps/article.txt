Assuming there's enough time, this is the general process that I go through for a given project -- whether it's a video, a graphic design, a website, etc:

1. Research & Assessment
2. Mockup
3. Execution
4. Iteration

Follow these steps, and tada! From out of nothing comes your spectacular work of art! Well, not quite. Each of these steps take a good amount of time and care. I hope to put up a few recent projects that showcase how each of these steps were hit (or missed). Stay tuned.
