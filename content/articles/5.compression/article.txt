### It's Friday night. There's a Gracepoint wedding the next day, and you have to send multiple video files to your friend. The problem is: you're down in Riverside, and your friend is up in Berkeley.

What **typically** happens next is no different from any other day: just upload those files. Meanwhile, your friend has to wait for you to finish that 1.2GB+ transfer, then has to kickoff that download. Total time: 2 hours.

Except everyone happens to be on the internet that night.

*Adjusted* total time: 4 hours.

No bueno.

There's a better way to do this. If you think about the typical export settings -- and contrast that with Canon's typical recording settings -- there's a lot of room for improvement. Canon (typically) records at 1080p; the final product is usually at 720p. Why not transfer it as such, then? 

This is where [MPEG Streamclip] comes in. It's a free compression tool that's available both on the Mac and the PC. Load your video in:

After you set your in and out points (like the Quicktime of Olde), go to File -> Export to QuickTime. Enter in these settings:

Boom. A 360MB video clip is easily compressed down to 45MB. Your stressed out friend will be less stressed out, and whatever tension you had between the two of you is now alleviated.
