Speaking of [Jason Santa Maria], he just updated his [website], which now looks more like mine. Except that his is still, by far, much better. It is worth pointing out that he, too, is focusing more on the written content. I like this quote regarding his redesign:

<blockquote>
<p>One of the biggest features this new design touts is less. Less cruft, less in the way.</p>
</blockquote>

And speaking of writing, it's been a while since I've written anything. Which is perfectly fine, when you're writing to an audience of none.
