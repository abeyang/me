It's been a while, but I've started to streamline this site. I'm playing around with [Bootstrap], as I'm particularly interested in its responsive properties [^1]. It was also a good excuse to play around with [Coda 2]. I'm also trying out [Git] as my codebase repository.

Some immediate benefits:

* Consistency across pages
* Better legibility (even for mobile devices)
* I can modify and tinker with the site in a different sandbox

You might also notice that what used to be "Projects" is now "Guides".

No guarantees, but I'd like to write about some of the projects I've been working on. Stay tuned.
