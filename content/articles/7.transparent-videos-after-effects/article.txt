### Using After Effects is a pain, especially when you're looping into it from Premiere. You use it because you need to do some simple animation. After you use it, you realize that you need to replace the footage with something else (it's never the final cut until it goes live). And so, you reopen After Effects, swap out the footage, and re-render.

There's an easier way to do all this. Rather than baking everything inside After Effects, why not just export the animation as a transparent video?[^1] That way, when you need to swap something out, it happens in the editor (like Premiere), rather than in After Effects.

First, let's toggle on the transparency. That way, you can distinguish your image/graphic/title from the transparent background:

![After Effects - toggle on transparency](@path/ae1.png)

After you're done with the animation, we'll need to export it in the right way. Follow this example -- the crucial step is outputting with RGB+alpha (default is just RGB)[^2]:

![After Effects - export with RGB+alpha](@path/ae2.png)

If you view your export in Quicktime, it looks as if it's over a black background. However, if you import it into Premiere, you'll notice that the black background isn't there:

![Premiere - transparent video overlayed](@path/premiere.png)

You can now swap out the video layer underneath to your heart's content.

[^1]: Of course, this doesn't work for all animations/title slides. You'll have to use your judgment.
