Latest project that I worked on. Rather than having organizations do all the fundraising, this web application gives power to the participants. I designed the overall look & feel and the interaction among the separate pieces. I worked closely with the product manager in mapping out features and scope; I frequently touched base with developers to ensure that each part is feasible given our time and resources.
