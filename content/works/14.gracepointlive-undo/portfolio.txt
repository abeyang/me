<strong>Undo</strong>. Special thanks to the Class of 2009, from modifying a potato launcher to shoot out flour to set design (and providing actors). Matt was the awesome cameraman who operated smoothly without a glidecam, and <a href="http://revolutioned.tumblr.com/">Richard D.</a> helped with graphic design and fashion tips. Props go out to Kevan, Jenny, <a title="pastor of Gracepoint Fellowship Church" href="http://edkang.wordpress.com/">Pastor Ed</a>, and <a href="http://kellykangblog.wordpress.com/">Kelly Kang</a> for guidance through the midst of the project, when things went awry. Another big thanks to <a href="http://www.conradchu.com/">Conrad</a>, <a href="http://blog.cleancutmedia.com/">Paul</a>, and Po for helping with all things post-related, such as grading, retiming, foley effects, and the most important part, creating the soundtrack in just one day.
