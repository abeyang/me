Designed and led development (small crew of four) from scratch for the [Gracepoint Riverside website]. Took about three weeks from design to version 1 release. 

Greatest power is in its simpicity &mdash; not only in how it looks, but by the controls. One flat file controls the majority of the information &mdash; information that spans across multiple pages (like time, location, rides, etc). I've purposefully avoided setting up a database.
