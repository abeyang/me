At my former company, we used to produce our final specs onto one gigantic PSD file, which was a pain to iterate over and consume. Thus, I developed a framework that was easy to modify (using markdown), and easy to consume -- especially within the Team, since all files reside on Dropbox ([example public Dropbox URL]). This Spec Engine is also available on [GitHub] for anyone to tamper and modify.
