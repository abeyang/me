Kareo Labs is the place where we can beta-test new ideas to existing customers. They can choose to like it or dislike it and explain why.

I designed the concept in Photoshop, trying to match the styles established in the Chrome project. After I got the thumbs up from the product managers, I coded the entire site &mdash; from HTML, LESS, jQuery/javascript, to a bit of back-end PHP logic sprinkled in &mdash; and delivered it to the real engineers.

Twitter Bootstrap was used as a starting point, but all the styles (buttons, modals, etc) were custom.
