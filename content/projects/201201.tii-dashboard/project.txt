Created a dashboard for instructors to get a pulse of what's going across all their classes. A big challenge was visualizing how things would scale (class size might differ), as well as keeping track of what things are actionable on what events. So, I've created a [prototype] (using jQuery and Twitter Bootstrap) to better help visualize the whole thing before it went into development and production. This allowed me to create a master list of students using javascript/json, and add them to different classes/assignments as I see fit. 

In addition, I also designed null states -- what the dashboard might look like if nothing has been assigned.
