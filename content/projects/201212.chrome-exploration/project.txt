We were toying around with the idea of bring our [current app] to become completely web-native. For this project, we focused only on the visuals &mdash; given the nomenclature and architecture we have today, what might it look like tomorrow?

Having a visual language to play with, interaction design will be more thought-out in subsequent projects (like the [Encounter Lifecycle]).

Needless to say, a lot of influence was drawn from the new "flat-design" aesthetic.
