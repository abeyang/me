			<div class="span7">
				<p>I design application interfaces and build websites. They must not only look good, but they must <em>feel</em> good, too. This means that many times, a lot of work goes into the things that you don't see, things like simplifying the user interaction and designing for an intuitive workflow.</p>
				<p>I also like to do Graphic Designs and Videos on the side.</p>
				<p>I currently live near Irvine, CA. If you're hiring, I may be interested &mdash; <a href="mailto:abeyang+job@gmail.com">contact me</a>.</p>
