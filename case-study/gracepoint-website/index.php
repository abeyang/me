			<h2>About this project</h2>
			<p>Two affiliated websites, serving two demographics (with a large overlap), but for two different purposes: one is to tell people about their venue on Sundays, and the other is to broadcasting their events throughout the week.</p>

		<div class="col-4">
			<h2>My role</h2>
			<p>I did the design for both websites, and managed the development across a small group of front-end and backend developers.</p>

			<p class="lead col-8 col-offset-2 text-center">Whenever I would go to a new city, I'm always frustrated by my experience whenever I look at a church website; they never seem to have what I'm looking for.</p>
			<p class="col-4 col-offset-2">Or, even if they do have the information, it takes a while sleuthing through the myriad of pages just to find the right information.
			</p>
			<p class="col-4">So, with this site, I wanted to make it simple, perculate all the relevant info to the homepage, and showcase the attended audience via <strong>big</strong> photos.

			<p class="col-6 col-offset-3">With 12% of the viewers coming to the site via their smartphones, it's absolutely critical that their experience is just as good &mdash; if not better &mdash; than that on the desktop.</p>

				<h2 class="pad top-30">The Grid</h2>
				<p>Twelve columns for the regular and extra-wide desktop views. It responsively collapses down as the viewport size decreases (from tablet down to smartphone).</p>

				<hr />
				<h2 class="pad top-15">No CMS</h2>
				<p>Not only does it not utilize a CMS, but there's no database hooked up, either. That's all by design; weighing in at four pages, this featherweight website is "controlled" by a single config (PHP) file.</p>
